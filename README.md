> ## In this repository:
- A Neural Network modeling to solve the classification problem for the *Labeled Markers* dataset 
    - **Tensorflow-Keras on Jupyter Notebook** 
- An algorithm to execute a Constrained Kmeans algorithm on the *Postures* dataset 
    - **Matlab**
    
You can find a detailed report about implemented methods in this repository : *"Datasets for Motion-Capture-Based Hand.pptx"*
